Understanding what is NReco and how it can be used needs some background in software engineering.

## Component Based Development ##
Idea of [component-based development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_componentry): when system divided into functional or logical with well-defined interfaces used for communication across the components. Component is system element that:
  * suggests multiple use (re-use); this means
    * inner-system reuse - can be used more than once in different context
    * global reuse - can be used as part of another systems without changes
  * does not uses hard coded context
  * able to communicate with other components
  * can take part in composition.

## Model Driven Development ##
[MDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_development) is development methodology that based on theory of [knowledge representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation) and [ontology development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(computer_science)). Inside MDD at least 2 different approaches exist: [General-purpose modelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-Purpose_Modeling) and [Domain-specific modelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_modeling). In most cases NReco refers to last one (DSM).
